        Retrieve a member by its ID.

        This method queries the database to fetch a member with the specified
        ID. It validates access permissions for the current user to ensure
        that the member can be retrieved. If the member does not exist or if
        the user does not have permission to access it, appropriate error
        responses are returned. In case of an exception during the process,
        an internal server error response is returned.

        Arguments:
            member_id (int): The unique identifier of the member to retrieve.

        Returns:
            Tuple[dict, int]: A tuple containing a response dictionary with
