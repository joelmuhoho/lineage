    Creates a test user linked to a single test family and commits changes to the session.

    This pytest fixture updates the provided test family object to associate it

    the changes to the database session. It then yields the test user object for
    use in test functions. The fixture ensures that the test user is linked to a
    family within the database session during testing.

    Args:
        session: Database session instance to manage the lifecycle and commit
            changes to the database during the test.
        test_user_1: A test user object that represents the user to be linked to
            the family for testing purposes.
        test_family_1: A test family object that will be updated to associate
            itself with the provided test user.
